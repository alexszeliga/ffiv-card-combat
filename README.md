# unit-4-game
A card-combat game that would be a licensing nightmare!

# Play this game on github pages!

# Game design notes:
I don't dislike StarWars, but I don't love it, so I'm making a superficial change to the game. It will be Final Fantasy IV based.

# Basic Gameplay:
Attack Power (AP) increases by the base AP every time you attack, so attack power will start very low and will end very high.

## Characters:

Because this is not an exercise in balancing characters in a card game, I'm going to swipe the values from the example to save time, but I will need to do some gameplay testing to ensure balance because not all of the necessary values are available in the demo.
