# unit-4-game
A card-combat game that would be a licensing nightmare!


# Play this game on github pages!

# Game design notes:
I don't dislike StarWars, but I don't love it, so I'm making a superficial change to the game. It will be Final Fantasy IV based.


# Basic Gameplay:
Click on a character card to select your hero.
Afterwards, your enemies will move down and change color to signify how evil they've become.

Next, select your enemy, but select wisely. Strategy is largely insignificant, but all players can win.

Once you've selected an enemy, click fight repeatedly until one of the div's is .empty()!

After each fight, you must select a new enemy.
